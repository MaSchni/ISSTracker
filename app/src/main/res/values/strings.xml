    <string name="info_text">The International Space Station (ISS) stands as humanity\'s most extensive and enduring space station to this day. Commencing its construction in 1998, it has been continually managed and enhanced through the collaborative efforts of 16 nations and five space agencies worldwide. As it orbits Earth, the ISS holds the distinction of being the most massive satellite in Earth\'s orbit and the most substantial human-made structure in space.</string>
